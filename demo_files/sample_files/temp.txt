This is a temporary file that will be deleted during the demo.

The File Integrity Monitor will detect this deletion and log it as an event.

Temporary files like this are often excluded from monitoring in production environments
using patterns like "*.tmp" or "*.temp" in the exclude_patterns configuration.

This file demonstrates:
- File deletion detection
- Event logging
- Baseline comparison
- Change tracking
