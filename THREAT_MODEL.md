# File Integrity Monitor - Threat Model

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive threat model for the File Integrity Monitor (FIM) system, identifying potential security threats, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies. The FIM system is designed to detect unauthorized file changes and maintain tamper-evident records, making it a critical security component that requires thorough threat analysis.

## System Overview

The FIM system consists of:
